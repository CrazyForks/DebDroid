# DebDroid - Debian On Android

> [!WARNING]
> This project only supports `aarch64`. It will terminate immediately if run on a different architecture.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is intended for Android devices running Linux kernel `3.10` or later (released December 2017). Older kernels are likely to cause major issues and are unsupported.

DebDroid provides a lightweight and minimal Debian chroot environment for Android devices. It manages an isolated, native Debian, Linux-like userland without depending on Termux or additional user-space layers. It's ideal for power users, developers, and tinkerers who want to run a sandboxed Debian environment as close to the actual Android system.

## DebDroid is not Termux

Unlike Termux or Proot, which run Linux tools via Android-compiled binaries or user-space emulation, DebDroid runs a real Debian chroot directly on Android. It ships its own programs, libraries, patches and links key Android filesystems into the Debian environment, providing near-native Linux functionality and the ability to run almost any Debian-compatible program.

## Features

- Small and portable.
- No external dependencies.
- Runs a minimal Debian Linux userland in a isolated chroot environment.
- Mounts key Android system paths to provide near-native Linux functionality.
- Employs `unshare` to isolate Android mountpoints from the chroot environment.
- Supports `/dev` overlayfs, creating a writable layer over device files without modifying the real `/dev`.

## Requirements

- A rooted Android device.
- A minimum 1-5GB of available storage space.

## Security implications

### RNG and Cryptography

This project patches certain system utilities, providing compatibility with the Android system by overriding Linux's randomness mechanisms, such as the `getrandom` syscall, `getentropy` function and glibc’s `arc4random` functions. It replaces the default cryptographic randomness with direct `/dev/urandom` reads. This is generally safe on modern Linux/Android, because the kernel ensures `/dev/urandom` provides high-quality entropy.

## Installation Guide

This guide is written for novice users. You only need basic knowledge of Android, like installing apps from unknown sources, extracting an archive, and a little experience using a terminal (command line).

### What You Need

Before starting, make sure you have these apps installed on your device:

- [Terminal Emulator](apk/TerminalEmulator.apk) - lets you access Android's command-line interface.
- [Hacker's Keyboard](apk/HackersKeyboard.apk) - an advanced keyboard that makes typing commands easier.
- [Root Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.speedsoftware.rootexplorer&hl=en-US) - lets you browse and manage Android files.

Alternatively, you can use a free alternative to Root Explorer, such as [Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.speedsoftware.explorer&hl=en-US) or [MiXplorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mixplorer.silver).

### Step 1: Downloading and Extracting the Project

1. Download the project zip file: [DebDroid-main.zip](https://github.com/NICUP14/DebDroid/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Locate `DebDroid-main.zip` in your `Download` folder (`/sdcard/Download`).
3. Extract the `DebDroid-main.zip` archive inside the `Download` folder. You can use an application such as `Root Explorer` or `MiXplorer` for this task.

After extraction, you should have a folder named `DebDroid-main` in your `Download` folder.

### Step 2: Installing DebDroid

1. Open the `Terminal Emulator` app.
2. Type the following commands, pressing Enter after each one:

```bash
su
cd /sdcard/Download/DebDroid-main
sh install.sh
```

The script will automatically install DebDroid files in:

- `/data/local/debdroid`
- `/sdcard/debdroid`

After that, DebDroid is ready to use!

## Quickstart Guide

### Usage

To display DebDroid's help page, run:

```bash
/sdcard/debdroid/debdroid.sh help
```

```txt
Usage:
  debdroid.sh [OPTION] [SUBOPTION] [ARGUMENTS]

Options:
  run [COMMAND...]
      Runs the default Debdroid environment.
      If COMMAND is provided, it executes that command inside the environment.
      If no command is given, an interactive shell is started.

  list [patch|command]
      Lists available scripts.
      patch   - Lists all patch scripts in the patch directory.
      command - Lists all command scripts in the command directory.

  patch [PATCH_NAME]
      Applies the specified patch script from the patch directory.
      Example: debdroid.sh patch fix_network

  command [COMMAND_NAME]
      Executes the specified command script from the command directory.
      Example: debdroid.sh command setup_user

  resize (+|-)[SIZE]
      Resizes the debian image relative to the specified size.
      Example: debdroid.sh resize +2G

Notes:
  - Unrecognized options are treated the same as the 'run' option.
```

### DebDroid Hierarchy

```txt
/sdcard/debdroid/
├── debdroid_env.sh   # Config script (paths, environment variables)
├── debdroid.sh       # Control script
├── debdroid_mgr.sh   # Backend script (mounts and manages chroot)
├── img/
│   └── debian.img    # Debian root filesystem
├── patch/            # Patch scripts
└── command/          # Command scripts
```

Scripts placed in `patch` provide easy-to-apply fixes and tweaks for the environment's misbehaving. For more information, check out the [patching section](#patching). The ones placed in the `command` folder can be easily executed to conduct specific tasks within the chroot environment, such as updating the system or managing ssh & vnc servers (coming soon!). Consult the [running commands section](#running-commands).

```txt
/data/local/debdroid/
├── bin   # External binaries
├── lib   # External libraries
└── mnt   # Debian mount point
```

Programs stored in `bin` can be run directly inside the chroot as it is mounted and appended to `$PATH`. Libraries placed inside `lib` will be automatically preloaded, allowing for custom overrides and patches without any modifications to Linux system files.

### Running Interactive Sessions

1. Open the `Terminal Emulator` app.
2. Type the following commands, pressing Enter after each one:

```bash
su
sh /sdcard/debdroid/debdroid.sh
```

This launches the environment and gives you a shell inside Debian.

Inside the chroot shell, users can execute the `exit` command to leave the environment and automatically unmount the filesystems.

### Running Commands

You can run a specific command inside the chroot without starting an interactive shell. DebDroid provides pre-made command scripts located in `/sdcard/debdroid/command`, which automate common tasks such as maintenance, setup, or service management.

To list available command scripts, run:

```bash
su
sh /sdcard/debdroid/debdroid.sh list command
```

To execute a command script, run:

```bash
su
sh /sdcard/debdroid/debdroid.sh command <command-name>
```

To execute other commands directly inside the chroot, run:

```bash
su
sh /sdcard/debdroid/debdroid.sh apt update
# or (explicit version)
sh /sdcard/debdroid/debdroid.sh run apt update
```

This will execute the `apt update` command directly in the chroot environment.

## Patching

If certain utilities or packages don’t work correctly inside the chroot, you can apply the provided patch scripts located in /sdcard/debdroid/patch. These scripts fix common issues, such as networking problems or other environment-specific quirks.

To list all available patches, run:

```bash
su
sh /sdcard/debdroid/debdroid.sh list patch
```

To apply a patch, run:

```bash
su
sh /sdcard/debdroid/debdroid.sh patch <patch-name>
```

## Notes

### Image Resizing

The Debian root filesystem (debian.img) in DebDroid has a fixed size. If you need more space, you can easily expand it using the built-in resize helper.

The following command expands the debian environment by 500MB:

```bash
su
sh /sdcard/debdroid/debdroid.sh resize +500M
```

For additional usage instructions, run:

```bash
su
sh /sdcard/debdroid/debdroid.sh resize
```

- Make sure the image is **not mounted** when resizing.
- Ensure you have **enough free storage** on your device to accommodate the new image size.

### Patching Apt

The `_apt` user is responsible for managing package downloads and upgrades inside the chroot. By default, it does not have network access due to Android group restrictions. This can cause errors during `apt update` or `apt upgrade`. Fix the issue by applying the `apt.sh` patch:

```bash
su
sh /sdcard/debdroid/debdroid.sh patch apt
```

After running this, the `_apt` user will have the necessary permissions to perform system upgrades without errors.

### User Networking

Due to Android group restrictions, users inside the DebDroid chroot need to be added to the `inet` group to access networking tools.

```bash
groupadd -g 3003 inet
usermod -aG inet <username>
```

After this, the user should be able to use networking commands like `ping`.

## Patched Programs

The following programs have been analyzed and patched to run properly within the DebDroid chroot environment:

- `gpg` – GNU Privacy Guard
- `sshd` – OpenSSH server
- `xfce4` - XFCE4 desktop environment (coming soon!)
