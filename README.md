# DebDroid - Debian On Android

> [!WARNING]
> The script only supports `aarch64`. It will terminate immediately if run on a different architecture.

DebDroid provides a lightweight and minimal Debian chroot environment for Android devices. It manages an isolated, native Debian, Linux-like userland without depending on Termux or additional user-space layers. It's ideal for power users, developers, and tinkerers who want to run a sandboxed Debian environment as close to the actual Android system.

## Features

- Small and portable.
- No external dependencies.
- Runs a minimal Debian Linux userland in a isolated chroot environment.
- Mounts key Android system paths to provide near-native Linux functionality.
- Employs `unshare` to isolate Android mountpoints from the chroot environment.
- Supports `/dev` overlayfs, creating a writable layer over device files without modifying the real `/dev`.

## Requirements

- A rooted Android device.
- A minimum 1-5GB of available storage space.

## Security implications

### RNG and Cryptography

This project patches certain system utilities, providing compatibility with the Android system by overriding Linux's randomness mechanisms, such as the `getrandom` syscall, `getentropy` function and glibc’s `arc4random` functions. It replaces the default cryptographic randomness with direct `/dev/urandom` reads. This is generally safe on modern Linux/Android, because the kernel ensures `/dev/urandom` provides high-quality entropy.

## Installation Guide

This guide is written for novice users. You only need basic knowledge of Android, like installing apps from unknown sources, extracting an archive, and a little experience using a terminal (command line).

### What You Need

Before starting, make sure you have these apps installed on your device:

- [Terminal Emulator](apk/TerminalEmulator.apk) - lets you access Android's command-line interface.
- [Hacker's Keyboard](apk/HackersKeyboard.apk) - an advanced keyboard that makes typing commands easier.
- [Root Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.speedsoftware.rootexplorer&hl=en-US) - lets you browse and manage Android files.

Alternatively, you can use a free alternative to Root Explorer, such as [Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.speedsoftware.explorer&hl=en-US) or [MiXplorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mixplorer.silver).

### Step 1: Downloading and Extracting the Project

1. Download the project zip file: [DebDroid-main.zip](https://github.com/NICUP14/DebDroid/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Locate `DebDroid-main.zip` in your `Download` folder (`/sdcard/Download`).
3. Extract the `DebDroid-main.zip` archive inside the `Download` folder. You can use an application such as `Root Explorer` or `MiXplorer` for this task.

After extraction, you should have a folder named `DebDroid-main` in your `Download` folder.

### Step 2: Installing DebDroid

1. Open the `Terminal Emulator` app.
2. Type the following commands, pressing Enter after each one:

```bash
su
cd /sdcard/Download/DebDroid-main
sh install.sh
```

The script will automatically install DebDroid files in:

- `/data/local/debdroid`
- `/sdcard/debdroid`

After that, DebDroid is ready to use!

## Quickstart Guide

### DebDroid Hierarchy

```txt
/sdcard/debdroid/
├── debdroid_env.sh   # Config file (paths, environment variables)
├── debdroid.sh       # Main entry script
├── debdroid_mgr.sh   # Backend script (mounts and manages chroot)
├── img/
│   └── debian.img    # Debian root filesystem
└── patch/
    └── apt.sh        # Patch for apt networking issues
```

```txt
/data/local/debdroid/
├── bin   # External binaries
├── lib   # External libraries
└── mnt   # Debian mount point
```

Programs stored in `bin` can be run directly inside the chroot as it is mounted and appended to `$PATH`. Libraries placed inside `lib` will be automatically preloaded, allowing for custom overrides and patches without any modifications to Linux system files.

### Running Interactive Sessions

1. Open the `Terminal Emulator` app.
2. Type the following commands, pressing Enter after each one:

```bash
su
sh /sdcard/debdroid/debdroid.sh
```

This launches the environment and gives you a shell inside Debian.

Inside the chroot shell, users can execute the `exit` command to leave the environment and automatically unmount the filesystems.

### Running Single Commands

You can run a specific command inside the chroot without starting an interactive shell.

For example:

```bash
su
sh /sdcard/debdroid/debdroid.sh apt update
```

This will execute the `apt update` command directly in the chroot environment.

## Patching

If certain utilities or packages don’t work correctly inside the chroot, you can apply the provided patch scripts located in `/sdcard/debdroid/patch`.

Run a patch script like this:

```bash
su
sh /sdcard/debdroid/debdroid.sh sh /sdcard/debdroid/patch/<script>
```

These scripts fix common problems, such as networking issues or other environment-specific quirks.

## Notes

### Image Resizing

The Debian root filesystem (`debian.img`) in DebDroid has a fixed size. If you need more space, you must manually expand the image:

```bash
su
truncate -s +500M /sdcard/debdroid/img/debian.img
e2fsck -fp /sdcard/debdroid/img/debian.img
resize2fs /sdcard/debdroid/img/debian.img
```

- Make sure the image is not mounted while resizing.
- Automating this process is still a work in progress.

### Patching Apt

The `_apt` user is responsible for managing package downloads and upgrades inside the chroot. By default, it does not have network access due to Android group restrictions. This can cause errors during `apt update` or `apt upgrade`. Fix the issue by applying the `apt.sh` patch:

```bash
su
sh /sdcard/debdroid/debdroid.sh sh /sdcard/debdroid/patch/apt.sh
```

After running this, the `_apt` user will have the necessary permissions to perform system upgrades without errors.

### User Networking

Due to Android group restrictions, users inside the DebDroid chroot need to be added to the `inet` group to access networking tools.

```bash
groupadd -g 3003 inet
usermod -aG inet <username>
```

After this, the user should be able to use networking commands like `ping`.

## Patched Programs

The following programs have been analyzed and patched to run properly within the DebDroid chroot environment:

- `gpg` – GNU Privacy Guard
- `sshd` – OpenSSH server
